# Digital Art Generation Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning

Diploma project consisting in developing an application that uses computer vision and deep learning to generate digital 
artworks. The first part of the project will make use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to generate the target images 
with the neural style transfer technique. The second part of the project will consist in using a more complex algorithm - 
generative adversarial networks (GAN) - for the same purpose. The performance of the two algorithms will be evaluated both 
visually and with objective metrics (Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance). Furthermore, a comparison between 
the two methods of generating digital art will be realized. This comparison will take into account: the functioning principle 
of the aforementioned algorithms, the quality  of the obtained results and the efficiency. The project will be implemented in 
Python, using machine learning libraries, such as Tensorflow/Keras and auxiliary libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc)
